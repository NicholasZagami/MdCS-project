## Project Description
The project consists of two sub-projects:
- **LinearSolver**: the first includes the implementation of 4 iterative methods: two stationary (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel) 
and two non-stationary (Conjugate Gradient and GMRES). The goal is to compare execution times and iterations 
required for the convergence of the aforementioned methods.
- **CustomDCT**: the second project aims to achieve two objectives: implementing a custom DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), 
- comparing it with the DCT from `scipy.fftpack`; the second is to verify what happens when applying the DCT to different 
- images by applying compression according to two parameters: the compression percentage and the block size.

The reports include an in-depth explanation of the implemented methods and the obtained results, both in terms of code and theory.
